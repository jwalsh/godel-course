:END:
  - What is mathematical logic?
  - Propositional logic: syntax and semantics
  - Truth tables and logical equivalences
  - Coding exercises

* What is Mathematical Logic?
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_DOCUMENT: notes.org
:END:
  - Study of formal systems in logic and mathematics
  - Provides a foundation for understanding mathematical proofs
  - A way to study formal languages and their interpretations

* Propositional Logic
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_DOCUMENT: notes.org
:END:
  - Basic building blocks: propositions, connectives, and truth values
  - Examples of propositional formulas:
    - \( P \)
    - \( P \land Q \)
    - \( P \lor \neg Q \)
  - Syntax: rules for constructing well-formed formulas

* Truth Tables
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_DOCUMENT: notes.org
:END:
  - A way to represent the truth values of propositional formulas
  - Columns represent propositions and connectives
  - Rows represent all possible assignments of truth values
  - Example: truth table for \( P \land Q \)

* Logical Equivalences
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_DOCUMENT: notes.org
:END:
  - Two formulas are logically equivalent if they have the same truth values
  - Examples of logical equivalences:
    - De Morgan's laws
    - Distributive laws
    - Identity laws

* Coding Exercises
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_DOCUMENT: notes.org
:END:
  - Implementing truth tables in Python
  - Evaluating logical expressions
  - Exploring logical equivalences

* Summary and Next Steps
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_DOCUMENT: notes.org
:END:
  - We learned the basics of propositional logic
  - Next week: First-order logic and formal systems
  - Coding exercises to reinforce concepts
